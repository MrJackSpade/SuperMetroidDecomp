# Compiled shared enemy math (#547)

## Implemented slice

EnemyTrigonometryTables contains immutable, typed samples for the shared positive
byte sine/cosine half-wave ($A0:B143, 128 bytes) and UnsignedSineTable ($A0:B7EE,
128 words). CommonMath and both Sbug vector paths now use these definitions
without runtime cartridge reads. The tables retain exact integer truncation,
including the byte table's 255 peak. No floating-point reconstruction, JSON,
asset fallback, ROM-image facade, or mutable table is introduced.

Removing instance/bus access makes the vector helpers and their pure callers
static. These signature changes do not alter their arithmetic or sequencing.
Existing independent whole/fraction negation, low-byte input truncation,
unsigned product wrapping and angle masking remain unchanged. No serialized
instance fields or save layouts change.

## Verification

Run SuperMetroid.Verification with `--compiled-enemy-sine` (also included in the
full suite). The reference reads the pinned cartridge, independently of the
compiled definitions, and checks:

- all 256 stored samples;
- all 65,536 byte angle/radius pairs, with poisoned high bytes;
- sine/cosine/negative-sine pixel and fixed-word results;
- signed and unsigned Sbug outputs in both vector phases;
- all 8,388,608 unsigned table-index/magnitude pairs under both native phase
  offsets, including 16-bit angle wrap and 32-bit signed reinterpretation.

Production helpers are invoked as static delegates without any bus parameter
or enemy-system instance. A ROM bus exists only in the independent reference.
The full Release verification suite passes on the final code, and Windows
Desktop Release builds with zero warnings and errors.

## Encounter audit caveats

Additional Climb Sbug, Draygon and Botwoon audits fail on both the changed build
and a clean detached build of ff4b0a3b, with identical diagnostics. They are NOT
passing evidence for this migration and were not weakened:

- #574: Sbug contact expects KnockbackActive immediately (health is correctly 59).
- #575: Draygon combined death assertion fails; music field is empty, death=957.
- #576: Botwoon already-defeated room expects a consumed $B797 publication.

Those diagnostics need separate investigation to distinguish obsolete fixture
assumptions from gameplay defects. The temporary baseline worktree was removed
after comparison; no historical executable remains available to launch there.

Follow-up: #574 and #575 were repaired as ordering-sensitive diagnostic checks;
#576 corrected mixed-population expectations and the wall spawner's missing
header identity. All three complete encounter audits now pass. See
BOTWOON-PLM-IDENTITY-576.md for details. The original baseline failures above
remain recorded as evidence, not silently rewritten as passing runs.

## Signed cinematic and tide slice

The compiled signed wave now reproduces all 320 words at $A0:B3C3-$B642,
including the negative-cosine prefix and the signed wave's +/-256 peaks.
Ceres approach/destruction and ending cinematic readers, plus the liquid tide
step, now consume compiled samples without runtime ROM reads. Matrix scaling,
tide arithmetic, and serialized fields are unchanged.

The regression checks all 320 words against the pinned ROM, invokes all three
production cinematic readers without a bus, and checks every 16-bit tide phase
under no tide, small tide, large tide, and both flags. These 262,144 tide cases
assert exact fixed-point offset and phase advancement, including small-tide
precedence. Invalid prefix indexes are rejected rather than silently wrapped.

Grapple migration was attempted but deliberately excluded from this commit:
Program.SamusGrapple replaces several ROM samples with invented axis-aligned
vectors to isolate collision geometry. The compiled wave exposed that dependency
(first assertion: anchor Y expected 56, actual 55). These fixtures must be rebuilt
using native vectors before switching that production reader. Their assertions
have not been weakened, and grapple continues using its existing ROM reader.

## Remaining work

This is not the entire lookup-table migration. Remaining signed-table callers,
linear/quadratic speed tables, family-specific tables, callback classification
reads and indirect/banked caller inventory remain. Mutable WRAM must remain
mutable, not become a compiled substitute. Wider ROM-free room/asset integration
is tracked by #530/#549. No player-visible fix or complete ROM-free gameplay is
claimed by this slice, and #547 remains open without a validation label.
